# SCA Findings Analysis

## Overview
The methodology used to prioritize vulnerabilities combines **CVSS** (severity score) with **EPSS** (Exploit Prediction Scoring System).  
Instead of using solely the **CVSS**, I enriched the analysis by checking the probability of exploitation (**EPSS**) for each CVE detected by SCA. For this purpose, I developed the script [osv-parser.py](https://github.com/paulocesarmsf/appsec_security_pipeline/blob/main/SCA/osv-parser.py), because:
  

- The JSON output generated by [OSV Scanner](https://github.com/google/osv-scanner) can become **large and complex**, making it difficult to extract relevant data directly.  
- It was necessary to get **EPSS scores** using the [FIRST API](https://api.first.org/data/v1/epss?cve=<CVE>), correlating CVEs with their exploitation probability.  
- This script parses OSV results, retrieves EPSS values, and exports a simplified [CSV file](https://github.com/paulocesarmsf/appsec_security_pipeline/blob/main/SCA/parsed-vulnerabilities.csv) with package, version, CVE, CVSS, and EPSS.  

**Ps:** Details on how to run the script are included inside the script itself.

## Summary

|---------------|---------|----------------|------|--------|----------|
| json5         | 2.2.1   | CVE-2022-46175 | 7.1  | 0.4049 | High     |
| certifi       | 2024.2.2| CVE-2024-39689 | 7.5  | 0.2123 | High     |

## Finding 1: json5:2.2.1 - CVE-2022-46175

**Description:**  
  `CVE-2022-46175` is a vulnerability in the `json5` package where untrusted input can trigger prototype pollution.  
  This issue may allow an attacker to manipulate an application’s object properties, potentially leading to unexpected behavior, data tampering, or security bypasses.  

**Severity**
- **CVSS:** 7.1 (High)  
- **EPSS:** 0.4049 (high probability of exploitation)  

This vulnerability is prioritized because it combines **high severity** with one of the **highest exploitation likelihoods (EPSS)**, making it a practical risk in real-world scenarios.  

**Exploitation Scenario**  
  An attacker could supply maliciously crafted JSON input that exploits prototype pollution.  
  This could lead to the modification of application configuration, privilege escalation, or introduction of arbitrary values into security-sensitive operations.  

**Mitigation Recommendations**  
  - Upgrade to a patched version of `json5` (≥ 2.2.2 or the latest available release).  
  - Validate and sanitize all untrusted JSON input before processing.  
  - **Use SCA tools and analyze your SBOM** to identify and continuously monitor vulnerable dependencies across all apps that include `json5` package.
