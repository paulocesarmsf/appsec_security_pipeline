# SCA Findings Analysis

## Overview
The methodology used to prioritize vulnerabilities combines **CVSS** (severity score) with **EPSS** (Exploit Prediction Scoring System).  
Instead of using solely the **CVSS**, I enriched the analysis by checking the probability of exploitation (**EPSS**) for each CVE detected by SCA. For this purpose, I developed the script [osv-parser.py](https://github.com/paulocesarmsf/appsec_security_pipeline/blob/main/SCA/osv-parser.py), because:
  

- The JSON output generated by [OSV Scanner](https://github.com/google/osv-scanner) can become **large and complex**, making it difficult to extract relevant data directly.  
- It was necessary to get **EPSS scores** using the [FIRST API](https://api.first.org/data/v1/epss?cve=<CVE>), correlating CVEs with their exploitation probability.  
- This script parses OSV results, retrieves EPSS values, and exports a simplified [CSV file](https://github.com/paulocesarmsf/appsec_security_pipeline/blob/main/SCA/parsed-vulnerabilities.csv) with package, version, CVE, CVSS, and EPSS.  

**Ps:** Details on how to run the script are included inside the script itself.
