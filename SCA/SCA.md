# SCA Findings Analysis

## Overview
The methodology used to prioritize vulnerabilities combines **CVSS** (severity score) with **EPSS** (Exploit Prediction Scoring System).  
Instead of using solely the **CVSS**, I enriched the analysis by checking the probability of exploitation (**EPSS**) for each CVE detected by SCA. For this purpose, I developed the script [osv-parser.py](https://github.com/paulocesarmsf/appsec_security_pipeline/blob/main/SCA/osv-parser.py), because:
  

- The JSON output generated by [OSV Scanner](https://github.com/google/osv-scanner) can become **large and complex**, making it difficult to extract relevant data directly.  
- It was necessary to get **EPSS scores** using the [FIRST API](https://api.first.org/data/v1/epss?cve=<CVE>), correlating CVEs with their exploitation probability.  
- This script parses OSV results, retrieves EPSS values, and exports a simplified [CSV file](https://github.com/paulocesarmsf/appsec_security_pipeline/blob/main/SCA/parsed-vulnerabilities.csv) with package, version, CVE, CVSS, and EPSS.  

**Ps:** Details on how to run the script are included inside the script itself.

## Finding 1: json5:2.2.1 - CVE-2022-46175

**Description:**  
  Prototype pollution in JSON5 via the `parse` method.  
  The package does not restrict keys like `__proto__`, allowing crafted input to modify the prototype of the resulting object. This can let attackers alter application properties, leading to unexpected behavior, data tampering, or security bypasses.  

**Severity**
- **CVSS:** 7.1 (High)  
- **EPSS:** 0.4049 (high probability of exploitation)  

This vulnerability is prioritized because it combines **high severity** with one of the **highest exploitation likelihoods (EPSS)**, making it a practical risk in real-world scenarios.  

**Exploitation Scenario**  
GitHub Advisory has a brilliant **[POC](https://github.com/json5/json5/security/advisories/GHSA-9c47-m6qq-7p4h)** to explain the exploitation scenario.  

But let's try to simplify it even further: 
- Imagine an app that decides what to do based on the user's role, for example an administrative action:
```js
const doSomethingAsAdmin = (user) => {
  if (user.isAdmin) {
    console.log('Doing thing as admin')
  } else {
    console.log('Action not allowed, you are not an admin')
  }
}
```
- An attacker could try exploit Prototype Pollution using the special __proto__ key:
```js
const JSON5 = require('json5');
const user = JSON5.parse('{"foo": "bar", "__proto__": {"isAdmin": true}}');
doSomethingAsAdmin(user); 
// Output: "Doing thing as admin"
```
- In this case, the attacker pollutes the object prototype, making isAdmin resolve to true and bypassing the intended admin check.

**Mitigation Recommendations**  
  - Upgrade to a patched version of `json5` (â‰¥ 2.2.2 or the latest available release).  
  - Validate and sanitize all untrusted JSON input before processing.  
  - **Use SCA tools and analyze your SBOM** to identify and continuously monitor vulnerable dependencies across all apps that include `json5` package.
